HILBERT CURVE

as you can find in this cool video on YouTube, Hilbert's Curve: Is
infinite math useful?, you can map the frequency space to a 2 dimentional picture of vise versa.

So one of my ideas to classify the tasks is to find the frequency components of the signals and then map them to a 
2D picture and them classify them using CNN methods.

Encoding the time series as Images

as you can find in this article, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoding-time-series-as-images-b043becbdbf3, I want to turn the timeseries data into images and classify them using CNN methods
