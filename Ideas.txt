===========================================
HILBERT CURVE

as you can find in this cool video on YouTube, Hilbert's Curve: Is
infinite math useful?, you can map the frequency space to a 2 dimentional picture of vise versa.

So one of my ideas to classify the tasks is to find the frequency components of the signals and then map them to a 
2D picture and them classify them using CNN methods.


===========================================
Encoding the time series as Images

as you can find in this article, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoding-time-series-as-images-b043becbdbf3, 
I want to turn the timeseries data into images and classify them using CNN methods




===========================================
Using the different channels in order to make images

As you know, the data which is provided by the orgnizers are given in 63 channels in which each channel is a time
series it self. at each snapshot you can gather gather together the data on different channels to make pictures
and then use the sequence of the images as different images to classify the EEG signals
