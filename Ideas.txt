HILBERT CURVE

as you can find in this cool video on YouTube, Hilbert's Curve: Is
infinite math useful?, you can map the frequency space to a 2 dimentional picture of vise versa.

So one of my ideas to classify the tasks is to find the frequency components of the signals and then map them to a 
2D picture and them classify them using CNN methods.


===========================================
Encoding the time series as Images

as you can find in this article, https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/encoding-time-series-as-images-b043becbdbf3, 
I want to turn the timeseries data into images and classify them using CNN methods




===========================================
Using the different channels in order to make images

As you know, the data which is provided by the orgnizers are given in 63 channels in which each channel is a time
series it self. at each snapshot you can gather gather together the data on different channels to make pictures
and then use the sequence of the images as different images to classify the EEG signals


===========================================
Transfer Learning
 
I have frequently seen on the papers on the BCI classification that Transfer learning has a very good effect in the
classification. So try to find the ANN architectures and use its first layers as transfer learning.

p300speller classification may be some how similar 

** Note that the transfer learning works well Convolutional Neural Networks
===========================================
Another Idea for the Transfer learning

It may be quite diffcult to find a trained model. One raw idea that I can propose is that make some new data (I don't know
you can make some new by taking the every two signal and add the mean of them as the new data set.
Then train the new model in which is a very heavy model with heavy training dataset.

And then you can use the a few first layers of the trained model to build your final model.

===========================================
Time Convolutional Neural Network

As you can find in this article : https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-convolutional-neural-networks-for-time-series-classification-56b1b0a07a57

CNN also can be used for time serires classification


===========================================
Echo State Neural Network

As you can find in the following article : https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-stock-prices-with-echo-state-networks-f910809d23d4

I think it is good to have a ESN classifier in the voters ensmble

===========================================
Time Frequency images

The time Frequency images may be use as the input of a CNN classifier.
